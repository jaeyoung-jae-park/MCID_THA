# Machine learning models of MCIDs and SCB prediction for Total Hip Arthroplasty patients

This GitHub repository is the supplementary material for the paper:
  Park J, Zhong X, Miley EN, Gray CF, "Preoperatively Predicting Failure to Achieve the Minimum Clinically Important Difference and the Substantial Clinical Benefit in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients using Machine Learning," BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders.
  
The "Experiments.R" script includes univariate analysis, risk factor identification, and predictions for the anchor-based MCID. For other outcomes, the anchor-based MCID can be substituted with the distribution-based MCID or SCB.

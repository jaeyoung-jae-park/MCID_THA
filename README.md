# Machine learning models of MCIDs and SCB prediction for Total Hip Arthroplasty patients

This GitHub repository is the supplementary material for the paper:
  "Park J, Zhong X, Miley EN, Gray CF, Preoperatively Predicting Failure to Achieve the Minimum Clinically Important Difference and the Substantial Clinical Benefit in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients using Machine Learning, BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders (under review)."
  
The "Experiments.R" includes univariate analysis, risk factor identification, and prediction for the anchor-based MCID. For the other outcomes, the anchor-based MCID can be replaced by the distribution-based MCID or SCB.
